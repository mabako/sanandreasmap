== San Andreas Map

A simple, Google Maps API v2 based implementation using the map from
http://ian-albert.com/games/grand_theft_auto_san_andreas_maps/

Points can be added/removed and so long only by registered users, while
registering is disabled by default in production mode, so either change that
in user.rb, create the user manually or copy another database over it.
Optional websites, along with a description for each node is possible, both
should stay on 3 lines on below for design reasons.

The map is run on https://ls.vg on a lighttpd + Thin stack, hence why the
thin.sh is just a shortcut to start/stop/restart everything easily. Again,
as to see a sample implementation, just visit that website and watch
everything happen.

Currently enforces SSL + Strict Transport Security. If you can't/won't use SSL,
least alone don't want to get one from StartCom or hate stuff in general, 
disable the filter in the application controller.
